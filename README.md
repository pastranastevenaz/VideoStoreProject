# VideoStoreProject
This project was built as a way to better learn to utilize the LAMP stack with a focus on database implementation. The front end is built with HTML, CSS, and very little Javascript. Basic PHP is the backend programming language, and MySQL is the database. I've included some MySQL database reverse engineer files and models.
