# VideoStoreProject
This project was built as a way to better learn to utilize the LAMP stack with a focus on database implementation. The front end is built with HTML, CSS, and very little Javascript. Basic PHP is the backend programming language, and MySQL is the database. I've included some MySQL database reverse engineer files and models. There are of course, several needed improvements I would like to make. I would also like to implement some more Javascript as I learn to use the tech. 

You will notice I used different methods in the PHP to connect to the database. I considered changing that to use one method, but decided to leave it as is, in order to have it as a reminder. I may change it as the project improves.
